My laptop turned off, and I had to wait for it to slowly reload, once I'd plugged it into a power source.

Feel my pain?

If you are the kind of person who sees the "You are now running on reserve battery power" message, ignores it, and then has your computer shut off rudely, I come bearing a gift:

Sleep Me.

This new app gives you 2 minutes after that apple popup to get your stuff plugged in before it... sleeps your computer!  How is this better? Doesn't apple give you 10 minutes?  Well, this way you are guaranteed not to have the battery drain all the way, and... after you plug in, your computer will wake right back up instantly!

Give it a try (and give me feedback):

Drag it to applications, and run it from there.  It has no UI, no dock icon, and will automatically relaunch when you log in again.  To disable that, go to System Prefs, and search for "login items"
